<b>Summary</b>

This is a simple calculator application primarily written in Javascript.  The user can perform simple mathmatical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  The interactive nature of this app taking in various button inputs and performing sequential operations was initially challenging for me and I over-complicated my first attempt at making the calculator.  

After cleaning up the code and reducing the number of global variables, the primarly challenge was in dealing with the equal sign as well as stringing multiple operators together.  Conceptually, I think this is the point where I had to really focus on keeping track of my variables as the user continues to interact with the calculator and logging into more inputs.

Overall, it was a good exercise in attempting something that seemed simple at the glance but was actually much more complicated than I expected.  Since the calculator is now functional, I've decided save the design/layout for another time so I can start coding in React as soon as possible.
